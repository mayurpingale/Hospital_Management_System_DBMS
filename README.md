# Hospital_Management_System_DBMS

In this project we have to develop a database for a hospital. The main aim is to store the details
of the patients, doctors and the billing system of the hospital. It stores the data of who people are
coming and which doctor are they consulting and in which room are they being admitted if so.
We store the patient details with their name, lab reports if any and where they are being admitted
to. We will create schema for these entities and integrate them to work properly.<br>
